        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Hello, I'm Dexter Riley. As a developer, with full stack solutions my goal is to create a user friendly experience that exceeds expectations. I participate in continued learning workshops that allow me to stay up to speed on new industry technology and trends.My goal is to create web solutions that allow businesses to run as efficiently as possible as well as keeping expenses low by keeping the business bottom line in mind.</p>
    </p>

        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>Outside of my commitment to my tech career, I have a passion for fitness. I am a big believer in health and wealth. I work out 5 days a week, most days before work. I feel as though working out before work gives me a sense of accomplishment that affects the rest of my day. After I workout I notice my creative juices are high along with my confidence. As a result I am in a mental state that prepares me to be the best developer I can be for potential clients
        </p>

        <h2>Portfolio</h2>
        <p>While working with full stack solutions I have worked on many projects, but there is one that I would never forget.The name of the project was Brown Elementary school and parents. Last quarter we worked on an elementary school website. Are task was to create a user friendly site that allows the school to efficiently share news and important information with parents. The goal was to make the website easy to navigate but not sacrifice quality. </</p>
